# About me
My name is Mathieu, I am software developer with a "classic" computer science background. 
Interested in computer graphics since I started programming, I fell in &#10084; with the Javascript/HTML5 world 
when I first went on [threejs.org ](http://threejs.org/).

I am currently enjoying the life in the great city of Montreal, Canada.
