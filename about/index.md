# About me
I am  web and computer graphics french developer.
After I graduated with my master degree, I moved in Paris and worked there as junior software engineer. 
Working in the [MATIS labs](http://recherche.ign.fr/labos/matis/accueilMATIS.php) at the french mapping agency on a web based
vizualization tool, I fell in &#10084; with the HTML5 world.
Although using Javascript and C++ in my day to day work, I consider Ruby as my favourite programming language. 

Currently enjoying the life in the great city of Montreal, Canada.
