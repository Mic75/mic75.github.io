          MCSquares is a modular dashboard system. The project is founded on kickstarter by Anthony Franco who
          was looking for a webgl developper to create an interactive 3D component for the project's site. I work
          on this as freelancer and it was a good occasion to play with the <em>Three.js</em> framework.

          The slip flap is a project I started while working at IGN and learning webgl. It was a good excuse to
          start practicing the first lessons from <em>learningWebGL</em> as it involves meshes generation, 
          transforms and texture mapping. It was also an occasion to play with the canvas API.

        <p>
          iTowns was a project I worked on during my time in the MATIS lab of the french mapping agency (IGN).
          The project is a web viewer in which you can navigate through LIDAR data, panoramic picture of streets,
          geographic informations, ... See it as a research oriented street view prototype.
          It leverages the HTML5 API and webgl for the front, the part I'have been working on.
