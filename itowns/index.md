# iTowns
iTowns was a project I worked on during my time in the [MATIS](http://recherche.ign.fr/labos/matis/accueilMATIS.php) 
lab of the french mapping agency (IGN). The project is a web viewer in which you can navigate through LIDAR 
data, panoramic picture of streets,geographic informations, ... 
See it as a research oriented street view prototype.

It leverages the HTML5 API and webgl for the front, the part I'have been working on.
